<h1>East Coast Rationalist Megameetup 2017</h1>

<p><strong>TL;DR: We put together a weekend-long gathering of rationalist
community people in NYC for the 2017 Solstice weekend.</strong></p>

<p>As you might already know, <a
href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1939801081/nyc-secular-solstice-2017-generations"
target="_blank">the seventh annual Secular Solstice celebration</a> happened this year in New York City on December 9, 2017. This meant we had a
whole bunch of people from the rationalist community all in town for the same
weekend.</p>

<p>Since many of us needed a place to stay anyway, we rented a big house
together in Astoria, Queens, and used that as the central gathering place, like
at Highgarden in 2014. This way we got to spend the weekend hanging out
together, with more flexibility to do things than if we all had to wander around
looking for a public space.</p>

<p>Besides Solstice and the afterparty, the big activity was an unconference
on Saturday afternoon. We also had a ritual lab, games, meals together, and other activities people wanted to run! There was also plenty of room for
unstructured socializing, of course.</p>

<p>This all cost $120.26 per person, which covered the rental plus
food and other expenses. For this, attendees got to sleep in the house Friday
through Sunday nights (or whatever subset of those they could make it), have three
meals with us (Saturday lunch and dinner and Sunday breakfast), and hang out
with a bunch of nice/cool/awesome ingroup people throughout the weekend.
(Solstice tickets were not part of this deal.)</p>

<p>Attendees who didn’t want to sleep in the house paid the reduced rate of $25.00 to
help cover food and other expenses.</a>

<p><strong>Registration was on a first-come-first-served basis, until
we ran out of room.</strong></p>

<p><em>Special thanks to everyone who preregistered and helped make this event
possible!</em></p>
