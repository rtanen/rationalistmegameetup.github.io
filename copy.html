<h1>Rationalist East Coast Megameetup 2017</h1>

<p><strong>TL;DR: We’re putting together a weekend-long gathering of rationalist
community people in NYC for Solstice weekend. If you want in,
<a href="#register">register below</a>.</strong></p>

<p>As you might already know, <a
href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1939801081/1947831394?ref=372512&token=a34aafd9"
target="_blank">the seventh annual Secular Solstice celebration</a> is
happening this year in New York City on December 9. This means we’ll have a
whole bunch of people from the rationalist community all in town for the same
weekend.</p>

<p>It’d be awesome if we could spend that weekend hanging out together, learning
from each other and doing ingroup things. Since many of us will need a place to
stay anyway, we can rent a big house on Airbnb together and use that as the
central gathering place, like at Highgarden in 2014. This way we’ll have more
flexibility to do things than if we all have to wander around looking for a
public space.</p>

<p>Besides Solstice and the afterparty, the big activity will be an unconference
on Saturday afternoon. We’ll also have a ritual lab, games, meals together, and
whatever other activities you want to run! There'll also be plenty of room for
unstructured socializing, of course.</p>

<p>This is all going to cost up to $100 per person for the Airbnb rental, plus
$25 per person for food (including at least Saturday lunch and dinner and Sunday
breakfast) and other expenses. (The exact Airbnb location hasn’t been determined
determined yet, because we don’t know how many participants there’ll be, but
$100 per person will be the upper limit on price.)</p>

<p>To gauge interest, registration is open from now until November 9. You’ll be
asked to authorize a PayPal payment of $125. It works like Kickstarter; you
won’t be charged until November 9, and only if there’s enough interest to move
forward. You’ll also only be charged your share of what the rental actually ends
up costing, plus the additional $25. For this, you’ll get to sleep in the Airbnb
house Friday through Sunday nights (or whatever subset of those you can make
it), have three meals with us, and hang out with a bunch of nice/cool/awesome
ingroup people throughout the weekend. (Solstice tickets are not part of this
deal; those are sold separately through the Solstice Kickstarter.)</p>

<p><strong>If this sounds like a good thing that you want to see happen and be part of,
then register before November 9!</strong></p>
